# Celestial-Bodies-Database

The project is a PostgreSQL database setup, specifically involving the creation and configuration of a database named "universe." The SQL file contains the structure and setup commands for the database, including encoding settings, ownership assignment, and configurations. The database is intended to be a part of a broader project, potentially for managing or analyzing data related to the "universe" schema or domain. The file showcases standard practices for initializing and preparing a PostgreSQL environment for further development and data insertion.
